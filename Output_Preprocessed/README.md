# Folder to hold fully prepared datasets for modeling.

6h_gridded_CA_{year}.nc are the 6hr resolution datasets for each year. The daily covariates (fm100,fm1000) are taken to be from the previous day to prevent data leakage in prediction. The 6hr NOAA covariates are provided for 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 every day. These are used to predict the wildfire risk for the next 6 hours. Missing values were small in quantity and filled using the most recent observation. These are not included in the repository since they are slightly too big for that. They can be found in this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KGSzYTvCHx74Bo6F5DgDdEgatKCvEukw?usp=sharing).

daily_gridded_CA_{year}.nc are the daily datasets. In this case all variables, including NOAA, are treated as daily resolution and thus must be adjusted to prevent leakage. We use 18:00 observations to predict the risk of the next day. Here I dropped the first day of 2020 because I do not have NOAA covariates on 12-31-2019 (as they were processed by another student).
